<h2>Mattias Top 3 Movies</h2>

<h3>Harry Potter: And The Philosopher's Stone</h3>
    <p>This was the first Harry Potter movie I saw. We wnt with my school class to the movies in order to see it.
        It brings back a lot of childhood memories to were we all wished we were a wizard and would get out letter from
        Hogwarts.

<h3>Sherlock Holmes</h3>
    <p>
    I just love Robert Downey Jr. in this movie. It's full of action and comedy and Robers plays the role
    so well. I could watch this movie over and over. I also love the setting och the era that this plays out in.

<h3>Lord of the rings: Fellowship of The Ring</h3>
    <p>
    This one as well brings back a lot och childhood memories. Where we all wished that we would go
    out in an adveture, The beautiful setting and landscapes of the movie just blew us away and with
    the storiy beginning, we knew that this would be an adventure to remember, even if we hadint read the books.
    Later on, me and my brother had a yearly rutial for a couple of years, where we would watch all the
    extended versions of all three movies in onw sitting. Good times, and good memories.
